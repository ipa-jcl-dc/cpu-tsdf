                            ####Surface Measurement parameters######
#Paramid image
num_level: 3
#Bilateral Filter, see OpenCV website
#Filter size: Large filters (d > 5) are very slow, so it is recommended to use d=5 for real-time applications, and perhaps d=9 for offline applications that need heavy noise filtering.
kernel_size: 5
#Filter sigma in the color space. A larger value of the parameter means that farther colors within the pixel neighborhood (see sigmaSpace ) will be mixed together, resulting in larger areas of semi-equal color
sigma_color: 1
#Filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value of the parameter means that farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough (see sigmaColor ). When d>0 , it specifies the neighborhood size regardless of sigmaSpace . Otherwise, d is proportional to sigmaSpace .
sigma_space: 1
                                #####TSDF Volume parameters #######

# ICP configuration
# The distance threshold (as described in the paper) in meters

BoundingBox:
 mixX: 0.03 
 maxX: 0.3
